### Hi 👋

I'm Lymkwi, or Lux. 🦊

I'm a Computer Science PhD student, and somehow I have a master's degree in Software Engineering 🖥️ 🎓.

I'm a tinkerer, interested in FOSS, network security, and kernel programming.
I mainly use [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) 🦀, [Python](https://python.org/) 🐍,
and [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt).
I also know some Java ☕, a healthy amount of Bash, and a light touch of Lua 🌙.

🔭 I’m currently a member of [Insalan](https://github.com/INSAlan), the largest student-led LAN tournament event in France. I was in charge of the network and systems team for the 16th edition (March 2022), which welcomed more than 300 players for a whole weekend.
I also maintain various tools to help automate my life, like [quantelconnect](https://github.com/Lymkwi/quantelconnect), or [Logboop](https://github.com/Lymkwi/logboop-rs/). I'm also a former core maintainer for [MinetestForFun](https://github.com/MinetestForFun/) where I managed and wrote hundreds of game mods (and learned git on the fly).

🌱 I’m currently learning about [Linux Kernel module development in Rust](https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux), trying to contribute network API support code, as well as asynchronous programming in Rust with [TokIO](https://lib.rs/crates/tokio/).

🎁 Currently involved in developing a fancy new website 👀

💬 Ask me about fox facts 🦊 and network protocols

📫 Reach me over at `contact <at> vulpinecitrus <dot> info` (though it can take a couple days for me to see your email)

😄 Pronouns: They/She

⚡ Fun fact: A group of foxes can be called "an earth".

If you're looking for more of the things I do, I have my own [git hosting service](https://git.vulpinecitrus.info/).
I also talk about some things I do on my [blog](https://vulpinecitrus.info/blog/).

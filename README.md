### Hi 👋

I'm Lymkwi, or Lux. 🦊

I'm a student aiming to get a computer software engineering degree 🖥️ 🎓.

I'm a tinkerer, interested in FOSS, network security and devops. I mainly use Rust 🦀, Python 🐍, and C. I also know Java ☕, a healthy amount of Bash, and a light touch of Lua 🌙.

🔭 I’m currently a member of [Insalan](https://github.com/INSAlan), the largest student-led LAN tournament event in France. I was in charge of the network and systems team for the 16th edition (March 2022), which welcomed more than 300 players for a whole weekend.
I also maintain various tools to help automate my life, like [quantelconnect](https://github.com/Lymkwi/quantelconnect), or [Logboop](https://github.com/Lymkwi/logboop-rs/). I'm also a former core maintainer for [MinetestForFun](https://github.com/MinetestForFun/) where I managed and wrote hundreds of game mods (and learned git on the fly).

🌱 I’m currently learning about [Linux Kernel module development in Rust](https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux), as well as asynchronous programming in Rust with [TokIO](https://lib.rs/crates/tokio/).

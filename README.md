### Hi

i'm `lymkwi`, or lux 🦊🐾🏳️‍⚧️

i'm a Computer Science PhD student, and somehow i have a master's degree in software engineering.

i'm a tinkerer, interested in FOSS, computer network, and kernel programming.
i mainly use [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) 🦀, [Python](https://python.org/) 🐍,
and [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt).
i also know some Java ☕, a healthy amount of Bash, and a light touch of Lua 🌙.

Most of my actual personal work happens on [my
forge](https://git.vulpinecitrus.info/), this account is mostly used for
projects already on GitHub nowadays.

Past stuff i've done includes:
 - former member of [Insalan](https://github.com/INSAlan), the largest student-led LAN tournament event in France. i was in charge of the network and systems team for the 16th edition (March 2022), which welcomed more than 300 players for a whole weekend, and helped develop the [new website](https://insalan.fr) for the 18th edition (February 2024)
 - various tools to help automate my life, like [quantelconnect](https://github.com/Lymkwi/quantelconnect), or [Logboop](https://github.com/Lymkwi/logboop-rs/)
 - former core maintainer for [MinetestForFun](https://github.com/MinetestForFun/) where i managed and wrote hundreds of game mods (and learned git on the fly).

i’m learning about [Linux Kernel module development in
Rust](https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux), trying to contribute network API
support code, as well as learning about Rust interop with other languages.
